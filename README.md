    <summary><h3>1. What is React and Feature of React?</h3></summary>

    <p>React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) and single-page applications (SPAs). It was developed and is maintained by Facebook, along with a community of individual developers and companies. React was first introduced in 2013 and has since gained widespread popularity due to its performance, scalability, and ease of use.</p>

    <p>React was initially developed by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, and was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011.</p>

    <h3>Features of React</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> React utilizes a Virtual DOM, which is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. This allows React to efficiently update and render only the necessary components, resulting in improved performance and a smoother user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Component-Based Architecture:</strong> React follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is divided into reusable and independent components. This modularity makes it easier to manage and maintain large-scale applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Declarative Syntax:</strong> React uses a declarative approach to describe how the UI should look based on the application's state. Developers can focus on what the UI should display, and React takes care of updating the actual DOM accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>One-Way Data Binding:</strong> React implements one-way data binding, ensuring that data flows in a single direction. This helps in maintaining a predictable data flow, making it easier to debug and understand the application's state.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich Ecosystem:</strong> React has a vast ecosystem with a multitude of libraries and tools, making it easier to extend its functionality and integrate with other technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> React has a large and active community of developers, which means there is extensive documentation, tutorials, and support available for learners and developers alike.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile App Development:</strong> React Native, an extension of React, allows developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using the same React principles and components.</li>
    </ul>
