# React Interview Question / Answer

## 1. What is React and Feature of React?

<details>

<summary>Answer:</summary>

<p>React is a JavaScript library that helps you build user interfaces for your websites or web applications. Think of it as a set of tools that make it easier for you to create interactive and dynamic elements on your web pages. </p>

<h3>features of React:</h3>
<ol>
<li> <b>Component-Based:</b> React divides your web page into smaller building blocks called components. These components are like puzzle pieces that you can put together to create a complete picture. Each component can have its own logic and behavior, making it easier to manage and reuse code.</li>

<li> <b>Virtual DOM:</b> React uses something called a Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to keep track of changes in your components. When something in your component changes, React doesn't immediately update the actual webpage. Instead, it updates the Virtual DOM first, and then figures out the most efficient way to update the real DOM. This makes your web app faster and more efficient.</li>

<li> <b>Declarative Syntax:</b> In React, you describe what you want your user interface to look like in a simple and declarative way. You tell React how you want things to be, and it takes care of updating the actual interface for you. This is different from the traditional way of web development where you might have had to worry about each small change.</li>

<li> <b>Reusability</b> Since React encourages you to break your interface into components, you can reuse these components across different parts of your website. This saves you time and helps maintain consistency in your design and functionality.</li>

<li> <b>One-Way Data Flow:</b> React follows a one-way data flow, which means that the data flows in a single direction: from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to understand how data changes and where those changes are coming from.</li>

<li><b>JSX:</b> JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that React uses. It allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript, making it easier to visualize how your components will look in the browser. </li>

</ol>

Overall, React simplifies the process of building dynamic and interactive web interfaces by breaking down your webpage into smaller reusable parts and efficiently managing updates to the user interface.

## 2. What is Virtual DOM?

<details>
   <summary>Answer:</summary>

Imagine you have a real-world painting and a copy of that painting. You want to make changes to the copy without affecting the original. The Virtual DOM in React is like that copy of the painting.

In web development, the browser's "DOM" (Document Object Model) represents the structure of a webpage. When you use React, instead of directly changing the real DOM, React creates a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.

When you make changes to your React components, these changes are first applied to the Virtual DOM. React then compares the Virtual DOM with the real DOM to figure out what parts of the actual DOM need to be updated. This comparison process is much faster than directly updating the real DOM every time you make a change.

So, think of the Virtual DOM as a smart assistant that helps React update the webpage efficiently. It's like making changes on a sketch before updating the actual painting, making the whole process smoother and faster.

## 3. What is SPA?

<details>
    <summary>Answer:</summary>
    
An SPA, which stands for "Single Page Application," is a type of website that loads and displays all its content on a single web page. Traditional websites often load new pages when you click on links, which can make them a bit slower as the whole page needs to reload.

But with SPAs, things work differently. When you interact with a button or a link in an SPA, only the necessary parts of the page get updated or replaced, without needing to reload the entire page. This makes SPAs feel faster and more responsive, similar to using a desktop application.

## 6. What does mean by state and its use in react?

<details>
    <summary>Answer:</summary>
In the context of web development and React JS, "state" refers to the data that a component holds and manages. Think of it as the current condition or information that a component keeps track of.

<br/>

Imagine you're building a to-do list app using React. The state would be where you keep track of the list of tasks. Let's break it down:

1. <b>State:</b> Think of it as a container within a React component that holds data. This data can be anything you want, like numbers, text, arrays, or objects.

2. <b>Usage:</b> When your app needs to display dynamic information that can change over time, you use state. For instance, in the to-do list app, the list of tasks can change as you add or complete tasks.


In summary, state in React helps your components manage and remember data that can change as your app runs. It's a fundamental concept that allows your app to be interactive and responsive to user actions.

## 7. What is JSX and why do we use it instead of js?
<details>
    <summary>Answer:</summary>
JSX stands for "JavaScript XML." It's a special syntax that you use in React to describe what the user interface should look like. It might look a bit like HTML, but it's actually a mix of JavaScript and XML-like code.

<b>why we use JSX in React:</b>

1. <b>Readability:</b> JSX makes your code more readable and understandable. It closely resembles the actual UI you want to create, which makes it easier to visualize and work with.

2. <b>Familiarity:</b> If you've worked with HTML before, JSX will feel somewhat familiar. This makes it easier for web developers to transition into React.

3. <b>Components:</b> In React, you build your UI using components. JSX makes it simple to define these components by writing HTML-like code.

4. <b>JavaScript Integration:</b> JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions directly within the markup. This dynamic nature lets you generate dynamic content and interact with data easily.

5. <b>Performance:</b> Under the hood, JSX gets compiled to regular JavaScript by tools like Babel. This compiled code is optimized for better performance, making your app run faster.

6. <b>Tooling:</b> JSX is well-supported by development tools and extensions, which can help catch errors and provide useful hints as you code.

## 8. What is <code>package.json</code>?

<details>
    <summary>Answer:</summary>

Think of it as a recipe card for baking a cake. When you want to bake a cake, you need to know what ingredients to use, what steps to follow, and how long to bake it. Similarly, when you're creating a web project with React.js, the <code>package.json</code> file tells your computer what ingredients (or dependencies) your project needs, what scripts (or steps) to run, and other important information.

<b>what's usually found in a <code>package.json</code> file:</b>

<ol>
   
<li>  <b>Dependencies:</b> These are like the ingredients for your project. They are other pieces of code that your project needs to work properly. For a React.js project, this might include things like React itself, libraries, and tools that make your job easier.</li>

<li> <b>Scripts:</b> These are the instructions or steps you can run to perform certain actions. For example, you might have a script to start your development server, another one to build your project for production, and so on.</li>

<li>  <b>Project Information:</b> This includes details about your project, like its name, version, description, and who created it. It's like the basic information you'd write on the cover of a book.</li>

<li>  <b>Configuration:</b> You can use the `package.json` file to configure how your project behaves. This could include things like setting up your project's default settings or customizing certain behaviors.</li>

<li> <b>Other Metadata:</b> There might be other useful information in there too, depending on the needs of your project. </li>

</ol>

So, when you're starting a new React.js project, creating a <code>package.json</code> file is one of the first things you do. It helps you manage the tools and libraries you're using, and it provides a way for you and your computer to communicate about how your project should be built and run. Just like following a cake recipe, your <code>package.json</code> file helps you create a successful and delicious web project!

## 9. What is the package name you are using for routing?

<details>
    <summary>Answer:</summary>

In the world of React.js, there isn't a single official package for routing, but one of the most popular ones is called "react-router-dom." Think of routing like giving directions to your web app. Just as you'd use a map to navigate from one place to another, routing helps your app navigate from one page to another without actually reloading the whole page.

With "react-router-dom," you can create different "routes" for different parts of your app. Each route is like a signpost that tells your app which content to show when a specific URL is visited. For instance, you might have a route for your home page, another for a contact page, and so on.

To use it, you'll first need to install the package using a tool like npm or yarn. Once that's done, you can import components like <code>BrowserRouter</code>, <code>Route</code>, and <code>Link</code> from "react-router-dom" in your code. Here's a simplified example:

<ol>
   
<li> Wrap your entire app with <code>BrowserRouter</code> in your main component. </li>

<li> Use the <code>Route</code> component to define what content should be shown for a specific URL.</li>
   
<li> Use the <code>Link</code> component to create links that users can click on to navigate.</li>

</ol>

</details>

## 10. Routing Implementation?

<details>
    <summary>Answer:</summary>

<p>Routing in React.js is like giving directions to your web application. Imagine your app as a big house with different rooms (components) inside it. Each room represents a different page or view in your app. Now, routing is like having a map with paths that lead you from one room to another.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re building a website with a homepage, an about page, and a contact page. In React, you&#39;d create a component for each of these pages. Then, you&#39;d use a router to decide which component (room) should be shown when the user clicks on a link or enters a specific URL.</p>
<p>React Router is like your map. It helps you set up these paths and tells your app which component to show when a certain path is visited. For example, if someone goes to &quot;/about&quot; in their browser, the router knows to show the About component, which is like opening the door to the &quot;About&quot; room in your app&#39;s house.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a simple example of how you might use React Router:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install React Router using npm or yarn: <code>npm install react-router-dom</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Import the necessary components from the library:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { BrowserRouter <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> Router, Route, Link } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'react-router-dom'</span>;
</code></pre>



<ol>
<li>Create your individual page components (<code>Home</code>, <code>About</code>, <code>Contact</code>), and your app will show the appropriate component based on the URL.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, when someone clicks on the &quot;About&quot; link, the router guides your app to show the <code>About</code> component. This way, you can create multi-page experiences within your single-page React app. It&#39;s like navigating through your app&#39;s house with the help of React Router&#39;s map!</p>
