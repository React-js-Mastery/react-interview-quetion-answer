# React Interview Question / Answer

<details>
<summary><h3>1. What is React and its Features?</h3></summary>

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) and single-page applications (SPAs). Developed by Facebook, it offers various features that contribute to its popularity:

- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a Virtual DOM to optimize updates and improve performance by reducing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** React promotes modularity by structuring UIs into reusable and independent components.
- **Declarative Syntax:** React uses a declarative approach to define UIs, allowing developers to focus on what to display rather than how to achieve it.
- **One-Way Data Binding:** React enforces a one-way data flow, enhancing predictability and debuggability.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** React has a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools, enhancing its capabilities.
- **Community Support:** React boasts a large and active community, providing resources and assistance.
- **Mobile App Development:** React Native extends React principles to building cross-platform mobile apps.

<summary><h3>2. What is Virtual DOM?</h3></summary>

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual Document Object Model (DOM) in memory. React uses it to optimize rendering performance. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Render:** When a component is created, React generates a Virtual DOM to represent its UI structure.
2. **State Changes:** When the component's state changes, React updates the Virtual DOM to reflect the changes.
3. **Diffing:** React compares the previous and new versions of the Virtual DOM, identifying differences or "diffs."
4. **Minimal Updates:** React calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM, minimizing costly updates.
5. **Efficiency:** By updating the actual DOM only when necessary, React improves performance and user experience.

<summary><h3>3. What is SPA?</h3></summary>

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that interacts with users by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. SPAs offer benefits such as smoother user experiences and reduced server load.

<summary><h3>4. Difference Between Class and Functional Components</h3></summary>

| Aspect                  | Class Components                     | Functional Components                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Syntax                  | Defined as ES6 classes               | Defined as JavaScript functions     |
| State Management        | Can manage state using 'state'       | Can't manage state directly         |
| Lifecycle Methods       | Supports lifecycle methods          | No lifecycle methods until Hooks    |
| Readability and Size    | More verbose and larger code         | Shorter, concise code               |
| Performance             | Slightly slower due to optimization challenges | Slightly faster due to fewer internal optimizations |
